# Javascript-strict-mode-

Welcome to the Javascript-strict-mode- project!

Javascript has some troublesome features which can be solved by activating the strict mode. This mode should be since ES5 backward compatible. That means early versions of js should ignore the mode.

The mode can be enabled by adding the following string into the js code:

"use strict";

To test the strict mode just download the files and execute index.html. Note that all files should be placed in the same folder so that the function of the code is guaranteed.

For the topic "concatenating strict files" use this Link: STILL IN WORK!
